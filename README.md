# CivicSense

## System's Specifications

The system allows the citizen to notify failures, problems, malfunctions and, in general, relevant events for a subject that provides services or manages infrastructure of public interest (water, electricity, roads, urban safety, etc. ...).

## Our Efforts

Software vulnerabilities represent one of the main weaknesses of an Information Technology system. Accordingly, security and privacy play a major role in preserving the confidentiality, integrity and availability of personal data.

Security should be embedded in software applications while privacy must be considered throughout all the software life cycle phases.
</i>General Data Protection Regulation</i> (<b>GDPR</b>) enforces protection of personal data while highlighting the concept of “Privacy by Design” – which is mostly based on the “Security by Design” principle.
Unfortunately, there are some limitations to take in account:
<ul>
<li>Privacy is subjective,</li>
<li>Data Protection Regulations only provide legal indicators,</li>
<li>There is a lack of privacy and security knowledge.</li>
</ul>
Consequently, due to these limitations, it’s necessary to support developers, designers and engineers during the design and development process of a software (both in forward and in backward).

The “Civic Sense” case study requested each member of our group to take the role of security expert in providing the development team guidelines and instructions to re-engineer the “Civic Sense” software system in a secure and privacy-oriented manner.

To accomplish this, two main tasks were fundamental:
<ul>
<li><i>Vulnerability Analysis</i>: The “analysis” phase was divided into two parts:
<ul>
<li><i>Static Code Analysis</i> via <b>Fortify</b>.</li>
<li><i>Security Fix</i>: which consisted in identifying vulnerabilities according to the OWASP Top 10; after that, we provided a possible solution to fix the identified issues by also clarifying the false positives.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><i>Privacy Analysis</i>: The goal was to identify both privacy design strategies to re-engineer the system, as well as privacy design patterns to implement each strategy, referring to the ones provided by the privacypatterns website. This last task requested also to provide a target a Client-Server architecture of the system, in the shape of a component diagram, integrating privacy patterns.</li>
